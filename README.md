## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python, based on standard Python type hints. It is designed to be easy to use and learn, while providing automatic data validation, interactive documentation, and robust performance.

### Key Features

- **High performance**: Comparable to Node.js and Go.
- **Type hints**: Uses Python type hints for data validation and editor support.
- **Automatic docs**: Generates interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation automatically.
- **Asynchronous support**: Built on ASGI, supports async programming for high concurrency.
- **Fewer bugs**: Type checking and validation reduce developer errors.

### Typical Uses

- Building RESTful APIs
- Microservices
- Real-time features (e.g., live updates, chat apps)
- Projects needing fast development and scalability.

## What is Uvicorn?

Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, used to serve FastAPI applications. It handles HTTP requests and supports asynchronous features, making it ideal for high-performance Python web applications.


## What is Pydantic?

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python. FastAPI uses Pydantic models to define and validate request and response data, using Python type annotations for automatic error checking and serialization.

## Advantages of FastAPI, Uvicorn, and Pydantic

- **Speed**: High performance, supports async and concurrency.
- **Developer productivity**: Fast coding, automatic docs, fewer bugs.
- **Data validation**: Pydantic ensures data integrity with minimal code.
- **Interactive documentation**: Built-in Swagger UI and ReDoc for testing APIs.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for both small and large applications, including microservices.

## CRUD Operations in FastAPI

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**â€”the four basic operations for managing data in web applications.

| Operation | HTTP Method | FastAPI Decorator           | Description                                 |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Create    | POST        | `@app.post("/resource")`    | Add new data                                |
| Read      | GET         | `@app.get("/resource")`     | Retrieve data (all or by ID)                |
| Update    | PUT/PATCH   | `@app.put("/resource/{id}")`| Modify existing data                        |
| Delete    | DELETE      | `@app.delete("/resource/{id}")` | Remove data                            |


## How to Run Your FastAPI App with Uvicorn

1. Save your FastAPI code in a file, e.g., `main.py`.
2. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
